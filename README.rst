Anti 1.8 Aktion
---------------

**Requires Fabric**

Are you, like me, still bitter about the Adventure Update to this very day? Still think Beta 1.7.3 was the best version?
Think that the hunger system is nothing more than a complete annoyance?

This mod disables the entire hunger system and just makes it so that food acts pre-1.8. You still get health
automatically on peaceful mode, but you get Regeneration II applied whenever you eat food.

You can still get the hunger effect, but it doesn't actually do anything.
